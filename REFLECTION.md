# Reflection on AI-Assisted Development

Working on the FuelEU Maritime compliance dashboard was an excellent exercise in building a real-world full-stack system with clean architecture.  
It helped me understand how environmental compliance data can be modeled and visualized using simple, well-separated layers.

Using AI agents like ChatGPT (GPT-5) and GitHub Copilot improved my efficiency significantly:
- **Scaffolding:** Generated base React and Node.js code instantly.
- **Refactoring:** Suggested cleaner naming, modular structure, and better folder separation.
- **Styling:** Helped me design a professional UI without relying on frameworks like Tailwind.
- **Debugging:** Pinpointed type errors, proxy issues, and API path mismatches quickly.

Despite these advantages, I also learned the importance of manual validation — AI often missed edge cases or assumed incorrect data types. I reviewed and corrected every piece before integrating it.

Overall, the process taught me:
1. How to design a compliant and scalable backend.
2. How to connect React with Express APIs effectively.
3. How to use AI agents responsibly to assist but not replace human logic.

If I were to improve it further, I would:
- Add unit/integration tests for all core APIs.
- Implement full CB calculation formulas dynamically.
- Add authentication and user roles (ship owner / regulator).

This project demonstrated that AI can be an excellent **co-developer** when guided thoughtfully.
